This is a proof of concept project where the objective is to build a code evaluation tool for grading code exercices, similar to Codeacademy, with Python, Flask and JavaScript, ReactJS.
The app itself, will allow a user to log in and submit solutions to a coding problem. They will also be able to get feedback on whether a particular solution is correct or not.

The main purpose of this project is to dive into Docker and container orchestration to help manage, scale, and deploy a fleet of microservices.
